\cf0 Qucs, briefly for Quite Universal Circuit Simulator, is a circuit simulator with graphical user interface. The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC, S parameter, harmonic balance analysis etc. Qucsator is a command line circuit simulator. It takes a network list in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs dataset. It has been programmed for usage in the Qucs project but can also be used by other applications. Pure digital simulations (VHDL and Verilog-HDL) are also possible.\
