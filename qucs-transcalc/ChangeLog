2006-10-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* coax.cpp (synthesize): Fixed synthesis equations for coax
	cable.

2006-08-19  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* units.h (ZF0): Added definition for wave resistance in vacuum.

	* coax.cpp (alphac_coax): Using 20/log(10) instead of 8.686.

	* rectwaveguide.cpp, microstrip.cpp, coax.cpp, c_microstrip.cpp:
	Using ZF0 instead of 120*PI wherever possible and necessary.

2006-01-30  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucstrans.cpp (slotCopyToClipBoard): Added supportexport function
	for coaxial line into clipboard.

2005-06-06  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* c_microstrip.cpp (show_results): Added computation of
	electrical and physical length.

2005-04-09  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucstrans.cpp (slotCopyToClipBoard): Added schematic creation
	for coupled microstrip.

2005-04-04  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucstrans.cpp (slotCopyToClipBoard): Started to implement the
	clipboard functionality used to created a schematic part for
	Qucs. Added a regex validator for the editable values.

2005-04-03  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* optionsdialog.h: Added configuration option dialog.

	* helpdialog.h: Implemented help dialog.

	* qucstrans.cpp: Applied reasonable default values for line
	properties. Implemented status bar. Improved radio button
	behaviour.  Implemented config file operations as well as loading
	and saving of transmission line files.

	* microstrip.cpp (synthesize): Computing length of microstrip
	line based on electrical angle during synthesis.

	* main.cpp: Saving and storing current property values in resource
	file on application startup and exit.

	* c_microstrip.cpp (er_eff_freq): Fixed P_9 formula.  Use '0.7913'
	instead of '0.7193'.
	(Z0_dispersion): Fixed Q_19 formula.  Use '4.9' instead of '4.19'.

2005-03-03  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucstrans.cpp: Initial attempt to create a 'transcalc' like
	GUI for Qt.  Thus the program can be ported for use with Qucs.
